# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

In this project so far, I have consolidated my knowledge of: if/while loops, iteration, defining and calling classes and functions.
