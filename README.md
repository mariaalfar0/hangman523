# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

In this project so far, I have consolidated my knowledge of: if/while loops, iteration, defining and calling functions.

### Usage instructions:

### File structure of the project:

milestone_2.py: 
- Sets up the word list and word randomisation
- Checks if guess is a single, alphabetic character

milestone_3.py:
- Encapsulates code from milestone_2.py
- Creates functions to check_guess() and ask_for_input()

milestone_4.py:
- Encapsulates functions from milestone_3.py into Hangman class
- Initialises attributes
- Checks if guess has already been guessed and appends it if not
- Docks lives for incorrect guesses
